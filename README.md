# otadump

[![crates.io][crates.io-badge]][crates.io]

**`otadump` helps you extract partitions from Android OTA files.** <br />
Partitions can be individually flashed to your device using `fastboot`.

Compared to other tools, `otadump` is significantly faster and handles file
verification - no fear of a bad OTA file bricking your device.
